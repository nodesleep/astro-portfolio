        And since Nick Tabick beat me to the dot com and won't let it go despite
        being dormant for years, I've gotta settle for dot dev. Anyways, I'm a
        software engineer. I've used titles like "FullStack" and "Web Dev", but
        that's very limiting and I'm much more capable than that.

        My work has ranged from software engineering, to fullstack, to design.
        I've worked as a consultant, contractor, and freelancer in all of these
        areas of expertise under my own company; building complex and robust web
        applications using JavaScript Frameworks.

        For the last year and a half, I've been focused on my education and
        learning new languages; taking special interest in Golang for backend
        programming and HTMX. Paired together, they do an extremely wonderful
        job of eliminating the bloat that SPAs carry with them when used for the
        wrong application.
